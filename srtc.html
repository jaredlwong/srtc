		<h1>Standalone WebRTC</h1>
		<h2>What is WebRTC?</h2>
		<p>
		WebRTC is a method of communicating data over the internet,
		usually in your browser, between two clients without the need
		for a central server. In other words, it is a peer-to-peer
		communication link.
		</p>
		<h2>What is this page?</h2>
		<p>
		This page hosts the fundamental operations of WebRTC
		highlighting its serverless/standalone behavior.
		</p>
		<p>
		The fundamental operations of WebRTC are video+audio streaming,
		and data communciation (such as instant messaging and file
		sharing).
		</p>
		<p>
		Down below is a simple example showing how WebRTC can operate
		without a central server (kindof, still need to the ice
		servers). You can do text, audio and video communication.
		</p>
		<h2>Browsers</h2>
		<p>
		Chrome is the only browser I've gotten to work. Partly it is
		due to a hack I rely on for getting ice candidates (I wait for
		a null ice candidate, which is not in the spec, it's just what
		chrome happens to do).
		</p>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Contact a friend. Tell them to go to this webpage.</li>
			<li>Decide on the same set of communications.</li>
			<li>One person should press "Start"</li>
			<li>The person who pressed "Start" should send the text
			that will be generated in the first box to the other
			person. This could be through email.</li>
			<li>The other person should input the text from the
			person who pressed "Start" into the first box.</li>
			<li>The other person will get some generated text in
			the second box.</li>
			<li>The other person should send that text to the
			person who pressed "Start".</li>
			<li>The person who pressed "Start" should put the text
			from the other person's second box into his own second
			box.</li>
			<li>In the end, both people will have the same text in
			each box</li>
			<li>Now communicate!</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Code</h2>
		<p>
		If you are interested you can find the code
		<a href="srtc.js">here</a> and <a href="pc.js">here</a>.
		Note that communications are going through a single server that
		is in charge of routing. That would be the ice servers, in
		particular, stun:stun.l.google.com:19302.
		</p>
		<p>
		But the ice servers just do the simple routing, setting up the
		NATs in between. They do not see any relevant information about
		the two parties involved beyond their IP addresses.
		</p>
		<p>
		Notably, this is still a minor security vulnerability.
		Otherwise data is communicated directly between the parties
		with 128-bit AES.
